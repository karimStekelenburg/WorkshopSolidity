## Installing prerequisites

### Getting started with MetaMask

MetaMask is a browser extension wallet that runs in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave Browser). It is easy to use and convenient for testing, as it is able to connect to a variety of Ethereum nodes and test blockchains. MetaMask is a web-based wallet.

Download and install the MetaMask extension from the Chrome webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

After you have installed the extension it should open a new window saying _"Welcome to MetaMask"_. If the window doesn't automatically open, you can click the new icon in your browsers toolbar (head of a fox). Click continue and choose a password to lock your account with. Be sure you remember this password. Continue with the next steps and accept the "Terms of Use", "Privacy Notice" and "Phishing Warning".

If you've done everything correct, you should be presentend with a "Secret Backup Phrase". This phrase consists of twelve words and allows you to recover your account when you lost your password or want to use the same account on a different computer. Your secret backup phrase makes it easy to back up and restore your account. Be sure to write this down and store it in a secure place. If your backup phrase gets compromised your account is compromised forever, no way back. Click next, fill in your backup phrase to let MetaMask know you did indeed write it down and skip the step for depositing Ether into your new account for now. Once you are done with all the steps youâ€™ll be able to see the details of your Ethereum account, as shown in the image below.

Your account page shows the name of your account ("Account 1" by default), an Ethereum address (0x93F4...4BfC in the example), and a colorful icon to help you visually distinguish this account from other accounts. At the top of the account page, you can see which Ethereum network you are currently working on ("Main Ethereum Network" in the example).
Congratulations! You have set up your first Ethereum wallet.
