# Solidity Workshop

## Installing prerequisites

### Getting started with MetaMask

Download and install the MetaMask extension from the Chrome webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) and follow the installation steps.

> MetaMask is a browser extension wallet that runs in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Brave Browser). It is easy to use and convenient for testing, as it is able to connect to a variety of Ethereum nodes and test blockchains. MetaMask is a web-based wallet. We are going to use MetaMask in this workshop to deploy and call our contracts. It is our gateway to the Ethereum network.

> During the setup you will be presented with a "Secret Backup Phrase". This phrase consists of twelve words and allows you to recover your account when you lost your password or want to use the same account on a different computer. Your secret backup phrase makes it easy to back up and restore your account. Be sure to write this down and store it in a secure place. If your backup phrase gets compromised your account is compromised forever, no way back.

Once you are done with all the steps youâ€™ll be able to see the details of your Ethereum account, as shown in the image below. Congratulations! You have set up your first Ethereum wallet.

> Your account page shows the name of your account ("Account 1" by default), an Ethereum address (0x93F4...4BfC in the example), and a colorful icon to help you visually distinguish this account from other accounts. At the top of the account page, you can see which Ethereum network you are currently working on ("Main Ethereum Network" in the example).

### Switching networks and getting some test Ether

Switch to the "Ropsten Test Network", go to https://faucet.metamask.io and click on the "request 1 ether from faucet" button to request 1 ether. You will now have 1 Ether to spend on the Ropsten test network.

> As you can see on the MetaMask account page, you can choose between multiple Ethereum networks. By default, MetaMask will try to connect to the main network. The other choices are public testnets, any Ethereum node of your choice, or nodes running private blockchains on your own computer.

> We are going to use the "Ropsten Test Network". The ropsten network is almost the same as the main network, except that it is meant for testing. In the ropsten network Ether has no value and there's no guarantee your data will stay on the network.
